Take a look at the Flode chart on the left, which shows a 'not equals' condition. Below is the Java code.

```java
if ( input0 != 100 ) {
  output( 'Is not 100')
}
else {
  output( 'Is 100' )
}
```

## !=
You may remember from the previous Unit that the `!` sign reads 'not' and so `!=` reads 'not equals'.
